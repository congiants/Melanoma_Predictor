# Melanoma_Predictor
A project meant to teach me the basics of CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks). The latest engine is able to predict malignant melanomas (skin cancer) with about 87% accuracy. 

## Required libraries
- tensorflow
- numpy 
- cv2
- matplotlib
- keras

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/congiants/Melanoma_Predictor.git`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install required_library`
3. The model is already trained and can be used. The two images in the root of the directory can be used for a quick test of the model
4. The model can also be trained on a different dataset 

## Dataset
Dataset used from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasnainjaved/melanoma-skin-cancer-dataset-of-10000-images

## Dedication
This project is dedicated to my late grandmother, Sofia Gargavani, who was taken away by this form of cancer.
